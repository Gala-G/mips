## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP70 modifies the DAI budget for the Growth Core Unit GRO-001.

## Paragraph Summary

MIP40c3-SP70 requests a 12-month budget of 5,085,157.11 DAI for the Growth Core Unit starting from July 2022 (Option BaseGrowth).

Due to the current market situation, we decided to propose a second option (option BearMarket) with a reduction in the objective FTEs, which will slow down our roadmap for H2-22 to H1-23. Option BearMarket requests a 12-month budget of 4,210,261.40 DAI for the Growth Core Unit starting from July 2022.

Personnel reduction from the original plan, although feasible, will have an impact on the roadmap execution of both teams (Growth and Brand) and the number of strategic initiatives we can run with our partners. In case option BearMarket is elected, we will:

* Reduce the number of new business opportunities or associations that require a high intensity of work (usually high impact partnerships)
* Instead of having a specialization approach (per region and vertical), we will continue with a generalist approach.
* Merge the communications and content team.
* Instead of having a separate team working on the brand, BDs will continue developing the Maker brand with our partners, with the PR agencies' support.

Although this is a more conservative approach and gives us time as a DAO to define the next steps towards MetaDAOs or any other path MKR holders decide, it's essential to understand that this will slow down Growth's CU roadmap (BDs+Brand).

**Option BaseGrowth** (5,085,157.11 DAI) represents a 55% increase compared to last year's approved budget. This increase in budget will support our growth in FTE, allowing us to expand our presence in other regions and have all people needed to run the Brand team.
**Option BearMarket** (4,210,261.40 DAI) represents a 28% increase compared to last year's approved budget. We won't be growing the team as planned but will be able to execute our plan with some constraints.
**Option BrandlessGrowth** (3,272,550.00 DAI) represents a 0% increase compared to last year's approved budget. If MKR holders select his option, we won't be able to continue with the Brand team plan.

## Motivation

Growth CU is requesting a budget allocation to deliver its mandate over the next 12 months (i.e., from July 2022 to June 2023). This budget will support the Growth team (i.e., initiatives to develop the MakerDAO ecosystem with new and existing partners) and the Brand team (i.e., a new incubated team within Growth CU and a set of tier-one providers to build a solid, reputable, and consistent brand for MakerDAO and engage strongly with the audience).

As we explained in the post “[The Maker Brand Team](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-maker-brand-team/14442)”, we want to incubate the Brand team inside the Growth CU to support team building and process implementations, until the team is ready to become an independent CU.

Since May 2021, we closed 141 integration with partners around the world, we helped with the onboarding process of stETH, MATIC, PSM-GUSD, PSM-USDP, generating more than 673M DAI and about 3.8M DAI in annual fees, and worked with other CUs on the ideation of an institutional product, that allowed us to maintain one-to-one conversations with companies that generated more than 1.2B DAI and about 29M DAI in annual fees.

With both teams, Growth and Brand, we will continue to help the protocol increase the supply and demand of DAI. The expansion of the Growth team will allow us to generate more opportunities inside the multichain ecosystem, bring more partners as collateral, increase the number of whales opening a vault and create more Dai usages. And by having the Brand team, we will be able to build a strong MakerDAO brand and extend its influence in DeFi and beyond. For more details on our focus and objectives for this year, please refer to the [GrowthCU Last year in review post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/growthcu-last-year-in-review-and-high-level-plan-for-next-year/15100).

## Core Unit ID

Growth (GRO-001)

## Option BaseGrowth.

### List of Budget Implementations

As Growth CU expenses are broken down into fixed and variable costs, we suggest two budget streams:

* Fixed monthly expenses of 311,092.16 DAI - constituted of personnel, marketing, and admin expenditures:
    * A total of  3,733,105.87 DAI will be streamed to 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e starting 2022-7-1 and ending 2023-6-30.

* Variable semi-annual expenses of 676,025.62 DAI (totalling 1,352,051.24 DAI) - constituted of partner and travel expenditures:
    * A total of 676,025.62 DAI will be transferred to 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e on 2022-7-1 (or as soon as the following executive allows).
    * A total of 676,025.62 DAI will be transferred to 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e on 2023-1-1 (or as soon as the following executive allows).

For details on the actual budget, please refer to the [GrowthCU Last Year in Review post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/growthcu-last-year-in-review-and-high-level-plan-for-next-year/15100).

#### New Budget Details

The current budget considers actuals from July 2021 to April 2022 and forecasts May and June 2022. As the estimates may be incorrect, any funds remaining in the Growth multisig in June 2022 will be returned to the protocol in the first month of our new term (i.e., July 2022).

Below you will find further details on the above cost items.

##### Personnel Expenses (48% of total budget)

This item includes personnel fees for the Growth and Brand teams and bonuses for the BDs.

The size of the Growth CU team increased from 5.5 FTE in June 2021 to 9.75 FTE in April 2022, and is expected to reach 15.75 FTE by August 2022 (10.25 FTE for Growth and 5.5 FTE for Brand):

* Growth team (from 7.25 to 10.25 FTE) - we plan to add three full-time members to the BD team to strengthen our efforts in high potential regions and accelerate our progress across our key initiatives. Besides the base pay, BDs benefit from a bonus pay scheme, a proactive process that forms goals around the account planning process. The budget for the bonus is therefore increased with the expected new hires.

* Brand team (from 2.5 to 5.5 FTE): the Brand team will build a team of experienced members in Branding and Product Marketing (cf. [The Maker Brand Team](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-maker-brand-team/14442) post for more details).

##### Partner Expenses (16% of total budget)

* Marketing activations: Budget to execute collaboration with Maker partners, including marketing campaigns, educational content, or grants to help partners build products. This also includes small events with partners during conferences.
* Loans: In some cases, depending on the relevance of the partnership, we use 0% loans to help our partners bootstrap their Maker integration.

##### Marketing Expenses (27% of total budget)

**Growth team:**
* The Marketing expenses budget line is to cover sponsorships for certain relevant events such as Hack Money and Mainnet, and media outlets such as Bankless.

**Brand team:**
* Hire Tier-1 global agencies specialized in crypto (to reach media outlets in the crypto world) and with mainstream access (for relevant news and RWA success stories). These agencies will help us create and distribute articles, webinars, media appearances, and podcasts.
* We will be using service providers to create written content, images, and videos that will serve as assets to include in the communications through different channels, including Twitter.

##### Travel Expenses (4% of total budget)

* To cover all expenses for travels to events (when relevant) and the offsite. The cost per FTE is expected at $12.397.

##### Admin Expenses (5% of total budget)

* **Fees:** This covers gas and OTC fees.
* **Professional Services:** Currently, we are working with two legal firms and one accounting agency. The budget increase is for additional hours to work on legal agreements with partners. This year, we want to establish a process where a legal contract accompanies commitments with any Tier-1 partner. It also increased because of the work with branding agencies that will support the Brand team.
* **Software Expenses:** To cover the usage of GSuite, Notion, Zendesk, Docusign, and Nansen.

##### Buffer

* The buffer will help us support any contingency that may occur during the year. The existing buffer holds $350k, and we are not seeking to extend this balance. It will continue as it is.

## Option BearMarket.

### List of Budget Implementations

As Growth CU expenses are broken down into fixed and variable costs, we suggest 2 budget streams:

* Fixed monthly expenses of 242,832.85 DAI - constituted of personnel, marketing, and admin expenditures.
  * A total of 2,913,994.22 DAI will be streamed to 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e starting 2022-7-1 and ending 2023-6-30.

* Variable semi-annual expenses of 648,133.59 DAI (totalling 1,296,267.18 DAI) - constituted of partner and travel expenditures.
  * A total of 648,133.59 DAI will be transferred to 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e on 2022-7-1 (or as soon as the following executive allows).
  * A total of 648,133.59 DAI will be transferred to 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e on 2023-1-1 (or as soon as the following executive allows).

#### New Budget Details

Below you will find further details on the above cost items.

##### Personnel Expenses (39% of total budget)

This item includes personnel fees for the Growth and Brand teams and bonuses for the BDs.

The size of the Growth CU team increased from 5.5 FTE in June 2021 to 9.75 FTE in April 2022, and is expected to reach 11.5 FTE by August 2022 (8 FTE for Growth and 3.5 FTE for Brand):

* Growth team (from 7.25 to 7.75 FTE) - we plan to convert a part-time contributor into a full-time one to support BDs in Asia and Latam. Due to this reduction of FTE compared to the option A budget, we won’t be pushing for growth in new markets until we have more certainty about stablecoins regulations and acceptance. Although this is a conservative option, the risk is losing the competitive advantage against others with a more aggressive approach.

* Brand team (from 2.5 to 3.5 FTE): We will add one FTE to the brand team with the role of CMO. This is an imperative role for this team's success and is the minimum viable team to execute the Brand plan. With a considerable reduction in the size of this team, we will have to slow down the execution of the brand roadmap.

##### Partner Expenses (19% of total budget)
* Same as Option BaseGrowth

##### Marketing Expenses (32% of total budget)
* Same as Option BaseGrowth

##### Travel Expenses (3% of total budget)
* Same as Option BaseGrowth updated with the FTE of Option BearMarket

##### Admin Expenses (7% of total budget)
* Same as Option BaseGrowth

##### Buffer
* Same as Option BaseGrowth

#### Increasing Value to Maker Token Holders

The Growth CU seeks to drive value to the protocol through:

- Revenue growth by helping with the onboarding of new collaterals and IVs

- Increasing DAI stickiness by adding more use cases around DAI and strengthening the Maker partners’ network.

- Building a solid brand image consistent with the value the protocol brings to the Defi market and broader.

### Roadmap and Objectives

For this year, our mandate remains the same, but we established a different strategy to suit Maker’s needs and the current situation of the ecosystem. Our growth plan for this year will be based on the following three key priorities:

1. Brand recognition: We decided to incubate the Brand Team due to the necessity of having a dedicated team working on the MakerDAO branding and announcements. The brand team will be working on :

- Define brand strategy and implementation plan for new strategic partnerships.

- Communicate on the protocol’s updates (i.e. products, ecosystem).

- Build brand awareness of MakerDao.

- Own and develop the protocol’s intangible assets of communication.

- Build strategic activations with providers (incl. one-off products).

2. Increase DAI supply:

* Multichain partnerships: Once we start deploying Maker Vaults in various domains, we will work to develop that ecosystem and generate integrations with Maker. At the same time, we will focus on integrating the Maker Teleport in various bridges and aggregators.
* Partners as collateral: Following the same strategy as last year, we want to propose valuable collateral to the protocol, and the multichain vision will open numerous opportunities for that.
* Partners opening vaults: We will continue pushing Institutional Vaults to bring closer Institutions to Maker.

3. Increase DAI demand:

* Multichain DAI: Providing easy access to MultichainCanonical-DAI on the most relevant platforms
* CeFi, DeFi: Creating use cases around the Multichain-Maker and incentivizing the re-establishment of Maker as a critical piece in the Money Legos.
* Dai users: Stimulate the usage of DAI.

### Business Case for Investment

After one year as a CU, we have been concentrating our efforts on expanding Maker’s ecosystem to increase the number of Dai in circulation globally. Throughout the period of 05/21-03/22, we closed 141 integrations with partners across various verticals and regions. With the development of new products around Maker (D3M, IVs, Maker Teleport, or even MetaDAOs) and a narrative plus brand to help us distribute the message, we will increase the number of closed integrations helping the protocol to grow on the supply and demand of DAI.

To increase DAI supply, we focused on four verticals:

**DeFi/CeFi:** we support the onboarding of new collaterals in the protocol by collaborating with PECU, CES, Oracles, and Risk. And we work with relevant aggregators to build a User Interface for the ilk. Once the product is finalized (i.e., an ilk with a UI and sometimes strategies on the back), we lead the public announcements on different media channels.

**This year, we helped onboard: stETH, MATIC, PSM-GUSD, and PSM-USDP, generating more than 673M DAI and about 3.8M DAI in annual fees.**

Currently, we are working on the multichain expansion by talking with other networks to support their implementation of the Maker Vaults. That will increase the SB by increasing the collaterals we can onboard on other domains such as Polygon or Gnosis Chain.

**Institutional Vaults:** Although we are still in the process of releasing the IV product, it has helped us to initiate conversations with companies with large crypto treasuries and introduce them to Maker. They are easily distracted by rewards other protocols offer and are not paying that much attention to Maker’s attractive services (e.g. lowest stability fees).

**Thanks to IV and the one-to-one conversations we have had with these companies, we helped to generate more than 1.2B DAI and about 29M DAI in annual fees.**

Currently, we are working with six companies to offer them an Institutional Vault. This process takes time as we have to educate their legal and compliance team about Maker and define the agreement for the vaults (as these vaults will be minting a minimum of 200m DAI). With Jocelyn leading the process, one of these companies recently posted its [proposal in the forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-antalpha-institutional-vault/15030).

**RWA:** We have been supporting the RWF team in getting new leads and supporting the onboarding process. Due to complications and unexpected events (e.g. late integration and change of RWF team), we have not yet been able to finalize the onboarding of any RWA collateral.

Currently, we are working with other CUs on the D3M implementation for TrueFi and Maple, opening new opportunities to interact with RWA. Also, we are supporting Strategic Finance on the strategy around stablecoins on the PSM.

For DAI demand, we focused on DeFi/CeFi: We provide easy access to Dai and Maker in the most relevant platforms and create use cases around DAI. We have posted the [Marketing Activations documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TGZJMkgyudwYALyuEJ0YQd-CFkyX_R39?usp=sharing) at the end of every quarter, highlighting our achievements during the period.

We will continue to work with our partners on the marketing activations but thanks to the Brand team's support we will be able to position the Maker brand and increase its recognition.

### Contingency Planning - Scenarios

* **Superbear:** If the DAO seeks to cut expenses in a bear or superbear market, GrowthCU will reduce expenses for non-business-critical activities: e.g., travel, sponsorships, and marketing activations.

* **Bull:** In a bull market, we would increase our Branding efforts by sponsoring more mainstream events and Maker’s appearance in the media.

### Unwinding and Defunding

If Growth CU is defunded, all current work will be halted to focus on wrapping up existing initiatives, creating documentation of existing processes, transitioning all Maker assets, archiving all information about partners, and the rescission of any active activity contract we may have. Any funds not already allocated (such as personnel fees and active agreements) at offboarding will be returned to the DAO through DSSBlow. We may need to use the buffer to cancel the active contracts and the unwinding of the company. All unvested MKR would be returned to the DAO as of the end date.
