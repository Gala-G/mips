## Sentence Summary

Add @psychonaut (Jpritikin Industries, Inc) as a co-Facilitator for Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security.

## Specification

### Motivation

I have worked as Deputy Facilitator for Immunefi Security since its inception on Dec 2021 and, during part of its incubation period under SES, two month prior (Oct and Nov 2021). I have taken charge of the accounting, wrote status updates, and contributed to our core unit's goals. Our current Facilitator, @travinimmunefi, continues to lead with long-term strategic planning, but is stretched thin by his many other responsibilities. Often, when Travin has scheduling conflicts, I am asked to attend the weekly Mandated Actor's meeting in his place. This MIP formalizes what is essentially already the status quo.

This proposal is not about compensation. My compensation will actually go down by about 1000 DAI/month because I will no longer be eligible for [SourceCred](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/what-is-sourcecred-and-how-do-i-opt-in/3913). The main motivation is to become vetted by MKR holders for the high-trust role mandated by our Core Unit.
