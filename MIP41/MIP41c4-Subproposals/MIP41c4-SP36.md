## Sentence Summary

MIP41c4-SP36 adds @luca_pro as the Facilitator for Core Unit LOVE-001: The Lending Oversight Core Unit.

## Paragraph Summary

I, @luca_pro, have been an active member of MakerDAO's community for a while, helping defining Maker's role along the crypto lending stack (also through the publication of the [Real-World Sandbox Report](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/real-world-sandbox-final-deliverable-for-consultation-round/11915?u=luca_pro)) as well as collaborating with several Core Units. I have an extensive 15+ years experience at the highest level of banking and fintech, and am a DeFi researcher through my Substack publication [Dirt Roads](https://dirtroads.substack.com/). I am a firm believer of MakerDAO's centrality within the DeFi ecosystem and intend to do everything I can to support this vision and the evolution of the DAO as Facilitator of LOVE-001.

## Specification

### Motivation

With this proposal, I put myself forward as the candidate facilitator for the Lending Oversight Core Unit. I am convinced that the DAO could benefit from my involvement, as an experienced financial professional, DeFi researcher, investor, and ultimately genuinely enthusiastic human being.

I believe that my involvement so far within the community can testify about what my role as Facilitator could be, and I am looking forward to this incredible journey as mandated actor, community member, and protocol ambassador.
