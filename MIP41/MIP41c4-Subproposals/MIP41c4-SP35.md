## Sentence Summary

This subproposal adds @tadeo as the Facilitator for the Data Insights Core Unit (DICU).

## Specification

### Motivation

I’ve been part of the community for the last year and a half, the latter six months working full time at DICU.

I believe that empowering people to make more data-driven decisions can have outsized returns. While data is supposedly available to anyone on the blockchain, there are technical challenges that exclude most users from using it meaningfully; from extracting, decoding, and contextualising it before being able to apply it to their use case. I see our role at DICU as enablers of this process and aim to build tools for the community.

While I initially joined DICU to focus on building these tools, I now see my role evolving also to include product management duties, coordinating with stakeholders, planning, and communicating with the wider community, enabling my colleagues to build amazing things.

My immediate focus is to open a continuous communication with the community so that work does not happen in a vacuum. While we are a small team, I believe we can have a massive impact on the protocol. I want us to serve the entire community, be CUs, delegates, partners and members who care about Maker.

I was warmly welcomed by this community and have found it incredibly enriching to spend my time here. I feel an enormous responsibility to reciprocate, helping both the community and protocol grow and I hope I keep serving you for years to come.
